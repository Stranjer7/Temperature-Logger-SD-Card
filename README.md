# Temperature-Logger-SD-Card

In this project a PIC18F452 measures the ambient temperature using ADC. UART and SPI modules are used for communicating with PC, connected via RS232 cable, and for saving results on the SD card. 

The program gives the user 2 options: 

-Send the results to PC via RS232 cable
- Save the results to a file on SD card

The program takes user input via a keyboard connected to the PC
